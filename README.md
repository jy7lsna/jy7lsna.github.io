# 📓 Scrapbook Portfolio — Jyolsna Maria Joemon

A visually stunning, interactive, and deeply personalized portfolio website designed with a **Notebook & Scrapbook aesthetic**. This project transforms the traditional single-page portfolio into a multi-dimensional digital notebook, complete with handwritten notes, polaroids, and interactive widgets.

## 🎨 Aesthetic & UX Design

The portfolio is built around a **Physical Notebook UI** concept, featuring:
- **Notebook Paper**: Subtle grid/line textures with realistic "spiral binding" and multi-colored pastel bookmarks.
- **Scrapbook Elements**: Scattered polaroids, 3D push-pins, "washi tape" strips, coffee stains, and hand-drawn stickers.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Page-turning transition animations, percussive tab-click sounds, and light/dark mode styling that shifts from a "daytime study" to a "nighttime lounge" vibe.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📅 Interactive 1:1 Meeting Calendar
Integrated with **Calendly**, visitors can select available dates and time slots directly on a scrapbook-themed calendar grid to schedule a meet with me.

### ✅ Habit Tracker
A persistent, state-aware widget where I track my daily progress. It features interactive toggles and a dedicated detail view modal for historical insights.

### 🎧 Live Spotify Integration
A theme-aware music widget showing my top tracks and what I'm currently listening to (Raindance!), adding a personal "vibe" to the digital space.

### ⌨️ Interactive Sections
- **Cover Page**: Features a smooth typing animation for the subtitle and a polaroid gallery.
- **Experience Log**: A detailed, categorized timeline tracing my journey from college to freelance web design.
- **Skills & Learning**: A list of core competencies and "Currently Learning" progress bars, styled without distracting card borders for a raw, handwritten feel.
